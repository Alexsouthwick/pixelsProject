Project description: Create your own digital image filter by writing a program to manipulate the pixels of an image. Your filter should be generalized enough to work on arbitrary images, not just the training set. In other words, you should be able to hand off your program to someone else to try on their own photos.

### Possible Ideas:
* A filter applied to a static image, such as the filters used by Instagram, Adobe Photoshop, and other apps.
* A filter applied to a moving image (video), such as the filters used by Snapchat and other apps.
* A filter that stores and retrieves secret data in an image. Steganography is the art of hiding a message within another message, such as by concealing a image or text inside an image.
* Or? Something completely different...
