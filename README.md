Create your own digital image filter by writing a program to manipulate the pixels of an image. Your filter should be generalized enough to work on arbitrary images, not just the training set. In other words, you should be able to hand off your program to someone else to try on their own photos.

### Possible Ideas:
* A filter applied to a static image, such as the filters used by Instagram, Adobe Photoshop, and other apps.
* A filter applied to a moving image (video), such as the filters used by Snapchat and other apps.
* A filter that stores and retrieves secret data in an image. [Steganography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) is the art of hiding a message within another message, such as by concealing a image or text inside an image.
* Or? Something completely different... 

### Starting Point Activity:

1) Play with the [p5.js image manipulation library](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Image). Start by loading and displaying an image. Then use the methods in the pixels example to play around with image manipulation. You will need an image to play with, and you'll need to be running a local server. [Here are simple instructions](https://lwhs.myschoolapp.com/app/faculty#topicdetail/305975/32277002/32277002/653432/0/0) for installing a local server with node.js.

2) Try [this still image starting point](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/pixelsProject/blob/master/minorManipulations.js). Make some changes, such as experimenting with the filters and then making a change of your own to some pixels.

3) Try [this live image from webcam example](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/pixelsProject/blob/master/videoTester.js). Make some changes, such as searching for other features other than amount of red in the image.

4) Play with [these experiments in computer vision] (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/cv-examples). 

5) And with [this face-tracking example] (https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr). 

6) Write down six ideas for possible filters that you'd like to make. Jot them on a piece of paper. When you have six, add them to the [brainstorm doc](https://github.com/lizzybrooks/pixelsProject/blob/master/brainstorm.md).
